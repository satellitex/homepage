# CSS Loading Fix for Next.js Static Export

## Problem
When running `pnpm dev` (Next.js development mode), the UI displays correctly with all CSS loaded properly. However, when building static files with `pnpm build` and serving them, the CSS files were not loading correctly due to path issues.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the GitHub Pages deployment configuration in `next.config.mjs`. The `basePath` and `assetPrefix` were set to `/homepage` for GitHub Pages deployment, which means:

- In development mode: CSS loads from `/_next/static/css/...`
- In production build: CSS loads from `/homepage/_next/static/css/...`

When serving the static files locally without the proper base path handling, the CSS files returned 404 errors.

## Solution

### 1. Updated next.config.mjs
Added proper configuration for GitHub Pages deployment:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
  output: 'export',
  trailingSlash: true,
  assetPrefix: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/homepage' : '',
  basePath: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/homepage' : '',
}
```

### 2. Removed Duplicate CSS Files
Removed the duplicate `styles/globals.css` file to prevent conflicts. The project now uses only `app/globals.css`.

### 3. Created Test Server
Created `test-server.js` to properly handle the base path for local testing:

```javascript
// The server strips the /homepage prefix when serving files locally
// This allows testing the production build with the correct paths
```

### 4. Updated Package Scripts
Updated the preview script in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preview": "node test-server.js"
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Development
```bash
pnpm dev
```
Runs in development mode with CSS loading from standard paths.

### Production Build & Test
```bash
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```
Builds the static files and serves them with proper base path handling for testing.

### GitHub Pages Deployment
The GitHub Actions workflow automatically handles the deployment with the correct base path configuration.

## Verification
The fix has been tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ All Tailwind CSS styles load correctly
- ✅ Component styling (cards, buttons, layouts) works properly
- ✅ Typography and spacing are correct
- ✅ Color schemes and gradients display properly
- ✅ Responsive design functions as expected

## Files Modified
- `next.config.mjs` - Added base path configuration
- `package.json` - Updated preview script
- `test-server.js` - Created for local testing
- Removed `styles/globals.css` (duplicate)

The website now works correctly in both development and production builds, with proper CSS loading for GitHub Pages deployment.
